The prince began to wear the slipper into Cinderella foot, and it was fit.<br /><br />The prince believed that Cinderella was the girl he met in the ball.

                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?"

                        The Ugly Duckling<br /><br />A long time ago on an old farm, lived a duck family. One day, Mother Duck had been sitting on a clutch of a new eggs. One nice morning, the eggs hatched and six beautiful yellow duckling popped out. But one egg was bigger than the rest, and it did not hatch. Mother Duck was suprised. How did it get there? ‘Tock! Tock!’ The duckling in that egg was pecking inside his shell.<br /><br />‘Did I count the eggs wrongly?’ Mother Duck wondered. Before the Mother Duck had time to think about it, the last egg hatched. A strange looking duckling with grey feathers worried Mother Duck. The ducklings grew quickly, but Mother Duck has a secret worry.<br /><br />‘I can’t understand how this ugly duckling can be one of mine?’ she said to herself, shaking her head. Well, the grey dukling certainly was not pretty. He ate far more than his brothers, so that he was outgrowing the other ducklings. By the time passed by, the poor ugly duckling felt more and more unhappy. His brothers did not want to play with him. He was so clumsy, and all the farmyard animals laughed at him because he is ugly. He felt sad and lonely, while Mother Duck did her best to cheer up him.<br /><br />Then one day, the ugly duckling ran away from the farmyard. He began to question all the other birds. ‘Do you know of any ducklings with grey feathers like mine?’ But everyone shook their heads in scorn.<br /><br />‘We don’t know anyone as ugly as you,’ they said.<br /><br />The ugly duckling did not lose heart, however, and kept on asking everyone he met. Then one day, his travels took him near an old countrywoman’s cottage. The old woman caught the ugly duckling because she was thinking he was a stray goose.<br /><br />‘I’ll put this in a hutch. I hope it’s female and lays plenty of eggs!’ said the old woman, whose eyesight was poor. The ugly duckling, however, did not lay a single egg. Then hen kept frightening him. She said that the woman would cook him if he could not lay egg. The duckling was frightened.<br /><br />Then one night, the ugly duckling found the hutch door ajar, so he escaped. Once again he was all alone. He fled as far away as he could, and at dawn, he found himself in a thick bed of reeds. One day at sunrise, he saw some beautiful birds flew above him. They were white, with long slender necks, yellow beaks and large wings. They were flying south to find food and new nests.<br /><br />‘If only I could look like them, just for a day!’ said the duckling, admiringly. Finally winter came. The weather became cold and the water was frozen. The poor duckling left home to seek food in the snow. He was exhausted and dropped to the ground. Luckily, a farmer found him and put him in his big jacket pocket. The farmer and his children look after him well.<br /><br />However, by springtime, he had grown so big that the farmer decided. ‘I’ll set him free by the pond!’ That was when the duckling saw himself mirrored in the water.<br /><br />‘Goodness! How I have changed! I hardly recognize myself!’ He was surprised because he became a beautiful duckling.<br /><br />The flight of swans flew north again and glided on to the pond. The duckling realized he was one of their kind when he saw them, and soon made friends.<br /><br />‘We’re swans like you!’ they said, warmly. ‘Where have you been hiding?’<br /><br />‘It’s a long story,’ the young swan replied, still astounded. Now, he swam majestically with his fellow swans. One day, he heard children on the river bank exclaim: ‘Look at that young swan! He is the finestof them all!’<br /><br /><br />Question:<br /><br />1.How was the duckling like when he came out of the last egg?<br />2.Did the duckling’s brother behave well towards him?<br />3.Why did the ugly duckling leave from the farmyard?<br />4.Who caught the duckling after he had left the farmyard?<br />5.What did the hen do when the duckling couldn’t lay egg?<br />6.Who took care of the duckling well?<br />7.Who was actually the young swan?<br />8.Can you mention the characters in the story?<br /><br /><br />Kunci Jawaban:<br /><br />1.He had grey feathers.

He was a clever boy, but he did not like to work.<br /><br />One day Aladdin’s mother sent him to the market place to look for a job. In the market he met a magician. The magician asked him to work together with him. If Aladdin could do, he would get a lot of gold coins and jewellery. The magician asked Aladdin to go inside the cave and find a magical lamp there. He also gave a ring and said, “If you are in any trouble, rub this ring and a genie will come to your rescue!”<br /><br />Aladdin went into the cave. Inside the cave, Aladdin was surprised by what he saw. Every corner was full of gold and treasures. A few minutes later, he found the lamp and quickly returned to the entrance of the cave. Aladdin called out, “Magician, I have found the lamp.” “Excellent,” answered the magician. “Quick, pass it to me!”<br /><br />Aladdin did not trust the magician so he said, “Not so fast Magician. You must help me out of this cave first.”<br /><br />The magician became very angry. When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.<br /><br />Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring. He rubbed it with the palm of his hand. To his surprise, a genie appeared before him and in a powerful voice said, “Master, I am the Genie of the ring. How can I help you?”<br /><br />Aladdin was frightened, but he soon found the courage to ask, “Could you please send me back to my house?” In no time at all Aladdin was back home.<br /><br />Aladdin took out the lamp. He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it. As Aladdin was rubbing it, all of a sudden another enormous genie stood before him. The genie of the lamp said, “Master, your wish is my command.” Aladdin was very excited and wished for an enormous palace and bags full of gold.<br /><br />One day, a beautiful princess was passing by Aladdin’s palace. She stopped to talk to Aladdin and soon they became good friends. Before long, Aladdin and Jasmine fell in love each other. She married Aladdin and lived happily.<br /><br />Questions :<br />1. What is the type of the text?<br />2. What is the text about?<br />3. What is the purpose of the text?<br />4. What kind of generic structure will you find in the text?<br />5. What is the main idea of second paragraph?<br />6. What's in the magic lamp Aladdin asked?<br />7. What is given by the magician to Aladdin?<br />8. "He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it." (8th paragraph). What does the underlined word refer to?<br />9. "The name was Aladdin.

They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />Moral of the Story- A true friend in need is a friend indeed.<br /><br />Hope it helps:)<br />
