<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>                                                   CINDERELLA</strong><br />
Once upon a time there was a girl name Cindrella. She
lived with her bad step-mother and two step-sisters. She had to do all the
household chores.

One day the king invited all the ladies in the kingdom
to go to a ball (pesta dansa)  in the palace. He wanted to find the Crown
Prince a wife.

The step sisters went to the ball that night with
their mother. Cindrella was left alone. She cried because she actually wanted
to go to the ball, too.

Just then a fairy godmother came. With her magic wand,
she gave Cindrella a coach (kereta),
two horses and footmen. She also gave Cindrella a lovely dress to wear the ball
and a pair of glass slippers. She told Cindrella to come home before midnight.

At the ball, Cindrella danced all night with the
Prince. The Prince fell in love with her. At midnight, Cindrella ran home.
Unfortunately, one of her slippers slipped off at the door. She did not have
time to put it back on. The Prince was sad as he could not find Cindrella again
that night.

The next day, the Prince and his men brought along the
glass slipper. They went all over the Kingdom to search for the owner.

After searching for along time, finally, they came to
Cindrella’s house. The slipper fit her. The prince was very happy to find
Cindrella again. They got married and lived ever after.

                        Beauty and the beast<br /><br />
Once
 upon a time as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of his 
three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The 
first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but 
the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest 
of them all, said to her father:  



 "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"   

<br /> When
 the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a
 sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the 
howling gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching
 an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of
 a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.   

"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. 

<br /> When
 he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody 
came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling 
out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner
 lay already served. The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner
 of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.  <br />
Overcome
 by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into 
magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a 
soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could 
not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. 

<br /> When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.  The
 merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to
 thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was 
nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it 
all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to
 a tree.<br />soal:1. who is the antagonist act on the story?2. how can the beast return to a handsome person?<br /><br /><br />

They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />Moral of the Story- A true friend in need is a friend indeed.<br /><br />Hope it helps:)<br />

                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

                        Social Media are Bad for Teenagers

Social media Web sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and many others have become nearly inescapable facets of modern life, particularly for teenagers. Social media is becoming more than just a part of their world, it’s becoming their world. Teens are spending more and more time online, usually on a social media platform like Facebook or Twitter. Most teens now have smart phones where they are on social media networks all throughout the day. They are constantly texting, tweeting, and posting pictures via Snapchat and Instagram. However, hyper-connected to social media could be bad for them.

Today teens don’t know how to disconnect. Social media has allowed them to take their life online from the time they wake up till they back to sleep via their smart phone. One reason this “always connected” activity is harmful is because of the alarming trend of cyberbullying. Bullying has now moved from not only being in the school and on the bus, but online. What does this mean? If a teen is getting bullied, they cannot get away from it! The people bullying them simply continue their bullying via social media

A new study has found that teenagers who engage with social media during the night could be damaging their sleep and increasing their risk of anxiety and depression. Teenagers spoke about the pressure they felt to make themselves available 24/7, and the resulting anxiety if they did not respond immediately to texts or posts. Teens are so emotionally invested in social media that a fifth of secondary school pupils will wake up at night and log on, just to make sure they don’t miss out.

Another impact social media has had on teens is teens being more comfortable online doing things that they should be more sensitive to doing. A separate study by the National Citizen Service found that, rather than talking to their parents, girls seek comfort on social media when they are worried. The survey also suggests that girls are likely to experience stress more often than boys – an average of twice a week.

Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and many others are basically created to connect everyone around the globe so they can interact and communicate each other. However, too much exposure of social media can also be bad especially for teenagers. As it mentioned above, social media could become media for bullying, risk them of anxiety and depression, and risk their real-life social interaction. Therefore, social media are dangerous for teenagers’ health both mentally and emotionally.<br />

                        Aladdin and the Magic LampOnce upon a time, there lived a handsome boy in Baghdad. The name was Aladdin. He was a clever boy, but he did not like to work.<br /><br />One day Aladdin’s mother sent him to the market place to look for a job. In the market he met a magician. The magician asked him to work together with him. If Aladdin could do, he would get a lot of gold coins and jewellery. The magician asked Aladdin to go inside the cave and find a magical lamp there. He also gave a ring and said, “If you are in any trouble, rub this ring and a genie will come to your rescue!”<br /><br />Aladdin went into the cave. Inside the cave, Aladdin was surprised by what he saw. Every corner was full of gold and treasures. A few minutes later, he found the lamp and quickly returned to the entrance of the cave. Aladdin called out, “Magician, I have found the lamp.” “Excellent,” answered the magician. “Quick, pass it to me!”<br /><br />Aladdin did not trust the magician so he said, “Not so fast Magician. You must help me out of this cave first.”<br /><br />The magician became very angry. When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.<br /><br />Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring.
